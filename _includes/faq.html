                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Choose the category that better defines your project’s stage. You can only apply to one of the categories.</p>

                    <h3>3.3 Can I apply if I’m a single person?</h3>
                    <p>An “Individual” can submit a proposal, but only by participating in a group of at least 2 persons, as indicated in the section ‘Type of Applicants’ within the <a href="/assets/IMPACT_Guide_for_Applicants_30092014.pdf">“Guide for Applicants”</a>.</p>
                    <p>IMPACT looks for high potential start-ups and, in this sense, a consolidated team is one of the most important aspects of achieving potential. That’s why IMPACT asks for teams of at least 2 persons full time dedicated to the project.</p>

                    <h3>3.4 Do we have to be constituted as SME?</h3>
                    <p>No, it’s not a requirement, because as indicated in Question 3.3. a group of at least 2 “individuals” can submit a Proposal. However, it would be recommended because IMP</p>ACT is looking for consolidated projects, even in legal terms.
                    <p>In any case, although you can apply as a group of individuals, or as SMEs in constitution process, if you are finally selected as beneficiary, IMPACT project will ask you to be articulated as SME before the first milestone of the IMPACT Acceleration Program.</p>

                    <h3>3.5 Do we have to be already selling or invoicing?</h3>
                    <p>It is not a requirement, but it would be positively evaluated, because one of the objectives of the Acceleration Process is that all of you, as beneficiaries, will be able to sell at the end of the 6 months of acceleration.</p>

                    <h3>3.6 If we are in another Acceleration Program, can we apply to IMPACT? </h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can apply but, if you are selected, you will have to sign a Declaration confirming that you won’t be in another Acceleration Program, once you will start IMPACT Program.</p>
                    <p>We do not accept beneficiaries which are, at the same time, committed with another acceleration program. It will be a conflict of interest and focus. A beneficiary cannot receive 2 mentoring, with different objectives and milestones, at the same time. However, if both acceleration programmes are not going to overlap time wise, you can apply for the IMPACT Acceleration program.</p>

                    <h3>3.7 How can I apply for the open call?</h3>
                    <p>You can apply for the call through the following link: <a href="http://www.fundingbox.com/IMPACT/apply" target="_blank">www.fundingbox.com/IMPACT/apply</a></p>

                    <h3>3.8 How long does it take to fill in an application?</h3>
                    <p>It shouldn’t take long. You only have to fill in the contest application form. Specific character limits have been established for each field.</p>
                    <p>An important issue to this respect is that you should have a clear project plan in terms of technology and business. Because you will be required to upload a Technology Map (including FIWARE Technologies Use Plan) and a Business Plan of the service/software to be developed.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, we highly encourage you to keep your proposal focused and relatively brief.</p>

                    <h3>3.9 What type of support is available for preparing the proposal?</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="/assets/IMPACT_Guide_for_Applicants_30092014.pdf">“Guide for Applicants”</a> is the main document of reference for you. It informs you about the evaluation and selection process of the proposals and the acceleration program offered by IMPACT.</p>
                    <p>Additionally a help desk service (<a href="mailto:opencall@IMPACT-accelerator.com">opencall@IMPACT-accelerator.com</a>) is articulated to solve all doubts you may have within the application process.</p>

                    <p>Finally a Technical Helpdesk service (info@fundingbox.com) is also available if you encounter any technical problem when fill in the Application Form.</p>

                    <h3>3.10  What is the deadline for the application?</h3>
                    <p>The deadline for the first call is November 7th 2014 at 15:00 p.m (CET). No application will be accepted after deadline.</p>

                <h3>4.1 What are the criteria for selecting the final beneficiaries?</h3>
                <p>The IMPACT selection process has been designed to be fair, fun and interesting for you.  Therefore we have designed a process in 3 phases.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Phase 1</strong>. You will present projects through the Funding Box platform. After filling the online questionnaire, those who meet the <strong>eligibility criteria</strong> (see Question Nº 3.1) and better align with the <strong>categories requirements</strong> (See Question Nº 3.2), will move to the next phase of selection.</li>
                  <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>. After that, each proposal will be evaluated by 2 independent experts who will assess different variables (Market opportunity, Technology, Competition/Differentiation, Commercial Strategy and Scalability, Financials & Metrics and Team)</li>
                  <li><strong>Phase 3</strong>. Finally, best rated proposals will participate in the Jury Day and will be interviewed by the Selection Committee that will select the final beneficiaries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information about the evaluation process, consult the <a href="/assets/IMPACT_Guide_for_Applicants_30092014.pdf">“Guide for Applicants”</a>.</p>
                <h3>4.2 What kind of rewards and benefits will IMPACT offer to beneficiaries?</h3>
                <p>If you are selected by the IMPACT Selection Committee, you will receive:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>An <strong>exclusive 6 months Acceleration Program</strong> which will include: 90.000€ of Funding, to be sequentially delivered against the accomplishment of the specific deliverables included in the ’IMPACT Sub-grant Agreement’ signed with IMPACT consortium, and 10.000€ in Services Vouchers, articulated through a Premium Acceleration Program consisting in Training and Mentoring under the guidance of key world class digital ecosystem professionals and entrepreneurs.</li>
                  <li>An <strong>Extended Investment Phase</strong>, beyond the European Commission funding support and therefore out of the IMPACT project, but which could be a very important step for you in terms of project sustainability. In this phase the project partners of IMPACT consortium will invite the most outstanding projects into their existing investment tracks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.1 Is there going to be an advanced payment to selected projects? </h3>
                <p>IMPACT funding schema is based on payments against validation of deliverables established on the ‘IMPACT Sub-grant Agreement’. That means that payments will be done after receiving and validating the beneficiaries’ deliverables. Therefore, there will not be advance payment.</p>

                <p>The beneficiaries will receive the 90.000€ in cash in three stages:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>1st Stage (Month 0)</strong>: 25%, once the <em>’IMPACT sub-grant Agreement’</em> has been signed and the deliverables indicated submitted and validated.</li>
                  <li><strong>2nd Stage (Month 3)</strong>: 50% once the criteria for this second stage have been completed and the deliverables submitted and validated.</li>
                  <li><strong>3rd Stage (Month 6)</strong>: 25% delivered in 2 batches. First batch of 10% at the end of the acceleration program, if all the objectives have been gotten, and the remaining 15% will be approved but the payment will be done when the IMPACT consortia will receive the last payment from the European Commission.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5.3 How will IMPACT monitor the progress of the beneficiaries? </h3>
                <p>Each beneficiary will have their specific deliverables/objectives included in their <stong>’Individual Mentor Plan’</stong>, which will be developed in the ’Welcoming Week’ and will be attached, as a formal requirement for beneficiaries, within the <em>’IMPACT Sub-grant Agreements’</em>.</p>
                <p>The <em>’Follow Up Individual Mentor’</em> assigned to each beneficiary will be in charge of monitoring the progress of the objectives proposed and the <em>’Acceleration Program Committee'</em> will validate the deliverables submitted by each beneficiary indicating if they are apt, or not, to go to next phase.</p>
                <p>For more information about the general deliverables/objectives assigned to each stage, consult the <a href="/assets/IMPACT_Guide_for_Applicants_30092014.pdf">“Guide for Applicants”</a>.</p>
