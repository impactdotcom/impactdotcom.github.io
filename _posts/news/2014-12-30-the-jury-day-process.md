The Jury Day event took place in Madrid on the 18th and 19th of December, marking the IMPACT Accelerator´s last evaluation phase.

We would like to thank you for being part of this great internet mobile multicultural gather! 
The **57 projects from all over Europe** competed to enter the IMPACT Accelerator program as a final step towards the funding. Ideas coming from **12 different countries** surely proved that together we can make a positive IMPACT on the digital world! 

Based on the Jury Day mandatory pitch, the Selection Committee had preselected the **29 candidates for a personal interview**, shortlisting them as potential Jury Day winners.

The Selection Committee consisted of **9 members** all together: 1 external evaluator, and 8 juries presenting one of the partners of IMPACT Accelerator. 
   The Selection Committee members were as follows:
   1.	**Nacho de Pinedo** ISDI´s CEO, IMPACT Steering Committee member and **Rodrigo  Miranda** the General Director of internetAcademi, IMPACT Steering Committee member**(Spain)**.
   2.	**Michael Kliendl** the Founder & Partner at Seaya Ventures, IMPACT Steering Committee member and **Beatriz González** Founding Partner and Director of Seaya Ventures **(Germany)**.

   5.	**Gustavo García Brusilowski**, (As an External Expert) Advisory Board Member at Chemo and Mabxcience, Klikin Cofounder **(Spain)**. 

**The 1st Open Call winners** who were announced at the **GALA ceremony** (the final closure of the Jury Day event), are advised to **SAVE THE DATE for Barcelona training 2nd – 11th of February, 2015.**
The training will take place at **ISDI, CAD** (Carrer Diputació 37, Interior 2A - 08015 Barcelona) and **Madia-Tic as part of the Barcelona City Hall/ Barcelona Activa** (Carrer Llacuna 162 164, 08018 Barcelona). 

We would like to remind these **20 lucky winners** (please see the image) that **they will officially enter the IMPACT Accelerator program once it is reapproved by the EU commission.** Once we have the EU validation, you will receive an e-mail indicating the following steps, and we will also publish a short description of selected stratups in a ¨Hot News¨ section of our website.

**IMPACT Team encourages all participants who did not make the final cut to try again for the following Open Call which is foreseen in May 2015** (the 2nd Open Call updates will be published on our website). 

**Thanks to all of you who have put their time and effort to make this event as special as it was: multicultural, creative, loud, busy, exciting and fun! See you again in 2015!**
