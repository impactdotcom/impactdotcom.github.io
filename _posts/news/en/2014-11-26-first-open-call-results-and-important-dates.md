Thank you for participating in the 1st round of the **IMPACT Open Call**. We have received 846 applications and 515 were successfully submitted. We consider this as a great outcome.  Take a look at the infographic.

In the first phase of the selection process 289 projects have been selected via the **FundingBox platform**. During the next few weeks, the **External Evaluators Panel** will evaluate the selected proposals and will choose the 57 best proposals to compete at the Jury Day, in Madrid on December 18th and 19th. The **Selection Committee** will shortlist the applicants entering the Acceleration program.

Once the deliberations have been completed, the results will be published on the website.  Good luck!!
