## A New Post

We would like to thank all the participants who have joined us for this exciting journey! **The 1st Open Call** has highlighted the 289 most creative, and promising internet mobile ideas. 

With great pleasure we announce that the External Evaluators Panel has shortlisted the 57 finalists who will be entering **the final evaluation phase at the Jury Day event** in Madrid, 18th & 19th Dec.

**Congratulations!**

As the image shows, the 57 Strat-ups will be competing on one of the given days: 18th or 19th Dec. 

The Jury Day will consist of two parts: **the pitch** (mandatory for each Start-up) and a **personal interview** (only for the projects selected by the Selection Committee). 

The winners entering the IMPACT Accelerator will be announced at the Jury Day Ceremony on the 19th Dec.

Shortly afterwards we will publish the results on our website.
