The selection has been done by 11 evaluators from all over Europe who chose the winners of the competition among 57 projects that participated to the Jury Day on Dec 9th and 10th  in Madrid.

The 18 teams will join the 42 already selected during the other 2 Calls and will commence the **6 month specialized mentoring program** held by the EU accelerator IMPACT composed by [**Buongiorno**](http://www.buongiorno.com/)(via its accelerator b-ventures) [**ISDI**](http://www.isdi.es), [**Seaya Ventures**](http://seayaventures.com/en/)and [**Teknologiudviking ApS**](http://www.technology-development.eu/) **.** IMPACT acceleration program kick-off will be a **Welcome Week** taking place in Madrid on January 12th, 2016.

The 6 month acceleration process consists of mentoring and training with key digital ecosystem experts and entrepreneurs. The Mentoring Plan involves 'follow-up mentors' (intended to follow continuously the team throughout the duration of the acceleration program) and 'specialized mentors' (specialists in different strategic areas such as entrepreneurship, technology, marketing and financing).

The training plan includes:

  * a face-to-face program on entrepreneurial digital acceleration which will cover the development of start-ups, digital marketing, technology and financing, all of that focused on the mobile environment;
  * e-learning courses about specific digital tools & capabilities necessary for the development of the companies.

These 18 applications come from a **total of 971 candidates, translated into 560 applications** received from 29 countries. Only 57 were selected to pitch in front of IMPACT Selection Committee at Madrid Jury Day on 9 and 10 December, 2015.

A large majority of the 57 mobile internet projects were of an outstanding level in terms of the quality of the team (mastery, skills, fluency) and the worth and attractiveness of the business ideas behind.
