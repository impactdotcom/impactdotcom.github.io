On 10th-11th April 2015, the second [**FIWARE HACKATHON**](http://www.impact-hackathon.com/) will be held in Florence.  The event is sponsored by **IMPACT**, one of the 16 consortia selected by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme.

24 hours of workshop and coding for participants to transform their ideas into tangible, innovative projects utilizing **FIWARE** technologies.

Cash prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place (**5,000 €**) and other **prizes** will be awarded to individuals from any of the teams that personally demonstrate an outstanding level of skill. 

The event is totally free, a work station will be provided with free internet, plus food, drinks and snacks; we ask you to bring your laptop, chargers and any extras that could be useful during the event. :)

The event, as well as offering possibilities for networking between aspiring startuppers, is also a prime opportunity to learn more about FIWARE and IMPACT’s accelerator program, whose next **call for applications will take place from April 1st to 30th with the aim to finance at least 20 startups with an initial funding of 100k euro**. 

Are you ready for the first FIWARE Hackathon in Italy?
