title: IMPACT ACCELERATOR will accelerate 11 more of Europe’s best FIWARE startups
---
## It’s official: IMPACT Accelerator has opened its doors to eleven more [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) startups. The initiative will offer training and premium services to mature startups. It comes after the third of three Open Calls and is called the **IMPACT Extension Program**.

While IMPACT Accelerator’s previous batches included many early-stage startups, the IMPACT Extension Program is specifically designed to offer **mature services to more advanced startups**. These services include additional funding, digital missions in Silicon Valley and the UK, mentoring and training, growth hacking education, equity crowdfunding, and micro-grants that will allow startups to attend and partner with top events across Europe.

A select group of startups will participate in the IMPACT Extension Program’s **Silicon Valley Digital Mission and UK Digital Mission**, an initiative which helps [strengthen the bonds](https://medium.com/@IMPACT_Accelerator/building-a-bridge-between-europe-and-silicon-valley-8ec7b227bca6) between European startups and the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

The startups will receive an extra **€50,000 each, equity-free**, to help them grow their businesses to the next level, focusing on marketing, internationalization, working with big corps, and achieving the next round of funding.

Out of 989 [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) startups in Europe, 31 were invited to apply for the IMPACT Extension Program. These 31 were judged to be the best, based on their integration of FIWARE and the strength of their business. Independent external evaluators and the IMPACT Steering Committee then chose the eleven finalists.

Startups taking part in the IMPACT Extension Program are:
