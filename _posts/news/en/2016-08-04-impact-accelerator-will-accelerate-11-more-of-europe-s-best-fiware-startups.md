title: IMPACT ACCELERATOR will accelerate 11 more of Europe’s best FIWARE startups
---
## It’s official: IMPACT Accelerator has opened its doors to eleven more [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) startups. The initiative will offer training and premium services to mature startups. It comes after the third of three Open Calls and is called the **IMPACT Extension Program**.

While IMPACT Accelerator’s previous batches included many early-stage startups, the IMPACT Extension Program is specifically designed to offer **mature services to more advanced startups**. These services include additional funding, digital missions in Silicon Valley and the UK, mentoring and training, growth hacking education, equity crowdfunding, and micro-grants that will allow startups to attend and partner with top events across Europe.

A select group of startups will participate in the IMPACT Extension Program’s **Silicon Valley Digital Mission and UK Digital Mission**, an initiative which helps [strengthen the bonds](https://medium.com/@IMPACT_Accelerator/building-a-bridge-between-europe-and-silicon-valley-8ec7b227bca6) between European startups and the Silicon Valley ecosystem.
