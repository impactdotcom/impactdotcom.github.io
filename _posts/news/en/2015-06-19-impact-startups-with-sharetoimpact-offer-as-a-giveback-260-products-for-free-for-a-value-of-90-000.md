**IMPACT** is finishing its first wave of acceleration. 

19 startups are in the final weeks of the acceleration program and they want to show their gratitude for receiving IMPACT´s support by offering a gift to the community. 

To this purpose we are launching the campaign **#ShareToIMPACT** to spread the word and to reach as much people as possible to deliver the gifts. 

This initiative will start **next June 23** and it aims at thanking the community, the European Union and Fiware program as they believe in #IMPACTers! and help them in developing their projects.

The gifts will be delivered to the users who participate in the campaign by filling up their info on IMPACT website. If there are more applicants than gifts, the winners will be selected according to their answers to the questionnaire.
