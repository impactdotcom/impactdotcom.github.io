In the two past Open Calls, IMPACT received the highest number of proposals among all the accelerators.

large majority of the mobile internet projects selected in the first two open calls were of an outstanding level in terms of the quality of the team (mastery, skills, fluency) and the worth and attractiveness of the business ideas behind. An important criteria in the selection process was that teams had already developed prototypes using selected components of the on FIWARE European digital technologies. 
Some of startup currently enrolled in the program are already successful cases in their reference market, such as [Intoino](www.intoino.com), [8Fit](www.8fit.com), [Chronobook](www.chronobook.com) and [Inevio](www.inevio.com).
