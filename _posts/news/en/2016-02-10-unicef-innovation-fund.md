title: UNICEF INNOVATION FUND

The United Nations will fund 60 startups to create open source technologies to improve the lives of children in developing countries.
 
Unicef, the children's charity run by the UN, will channel more than $9 million into startups based on venture capital-style investing. But it isn't concerned if the companies fail.
 
The money from Unicef's Innovation Fund will go to around 50 to 60 startups using open-source technology, and which have working prototypes. Each will get approximately $50,000 to help them grow. Companies have to be at an early stage and will be picked based on the strength of their teams, the work's relevance to children, and their future potential.
 
Startups wanting to apply for [funding from the UN](http://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/ ) must submit initial interests by 26 February.
